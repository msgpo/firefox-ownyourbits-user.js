A `user.js` is a configuration file that can control hundreds of Firefox settings. For a more technical breakdown and explanation, you can read more on the [overview](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki/1.1-Overview) wiki page.

The [ghacks user.js](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/blob/master/user.js) is a template, which, as provided, aims (![](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/blob/master/wikipiki/exclamation.png) with [extensions](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki/Appendix-B:-Extensions) <sup>1</sup> ) to provide as much privacy and enhanced security as possible, and to reduce tracking and fingerprinting as much as possible - while minimizing any loss of functionality and breakage (but it will happen).

We aim to INFORM and give you CHOICES. No one size fits all, so customize it! And not all sites have the same requirements, so use [profiles](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki/2.3-Concurrent-Profiles) with custom versions. We won't set you wrong.

INFORMATION IS POWER. So you can make informed decisions to better protect yourself online, we aim to be:

* Accessible (provide information and simpler, less-technical descriptions if possible)
* Accountable (provide reputable references/sources, [test sites](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki/Appendix-C:-Test-Sites), dispel bad advice)
* Change trackable (yay! we're on github now, with commits)
* Compatible (including a [deprecated section](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/issues/123), [releases](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/releases))
* Comprehensive (including enforcing defaults and future-proofing)
* Current and up-to-date with stable (including [changelogs](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/search?q=label%3Achangelog&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93))
* Detailed (preference versioning, hidden preference information, explanations, and more)
* Easy to use and discuss (sections, sub-sections, numbering)
* Helpful (including a [wiki](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki) with features such as [extensions](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki/Appendix-B:-Extensions), [user scripts](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki/3.1-User-Scripts), [references](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki/Appendix-D:-References) and more)
* Innovative (formatting, special tags, and future plans such as branches)

Everyone, experts included, should at least read the [implementation](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki/1.3-Implementation) wiki page, as it contains important information regarding a few default settings we use. The rest of the [wiki](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki) is helpful as well.

<sup>1</sup> ![](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/blob/master/wikipiki/exclamation.png) Important: We HIGHLY recommend using uBlock Origin, uMatrix and a cookie extension. Section 0400, if modified, allows Tracking Protection and Safe Browsing to be disabled. Do this at your own risk. See the [implementation](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki/1.3-Implementation) wiki page for more.

<sup>2</sup> The ghacks user.js was an independent project by [Thorin-Oakenpants](https://github.com/Thorin-Oakenpants) started in early 2015 and was [first published](https://www.ghacks.net/2015/08/18/a-comprehensive-list-of-firefox-privacy-and-security-settings/) at ghacks in August 2015. It was kept up-to-date and expanded by the original author with three major updates and articles. With Martin Brinkmann's blessing, it will keep the ghacks name.
