## Own Your Bits user.js preferences for Firefox

This repository is a fork from [ghacks user.js](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/), with some preferences relaxed for convenience and performance.

It will be periodically rebased from the ghacks version, and you can use it as it is or as a reference.

Read carefully the instructions in [ghacks](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/), or at least backup your profile folder before trying this.

In contrast to the ghacks version, this user.js does not remove your history and stored data but still **you need to backup first**. I will not hold responsible for any data loss.
